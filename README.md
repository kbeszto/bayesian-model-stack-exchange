Bayesian Model for Question Popularity on Stack Exchange

This report investigates the factors that influence the popularity of technical questions on Stack Exchange through constructing and comparing Bayesian and Frequentist Logistic Regression models. Utilizing a dataset of 10000 posted questions retrieved from the Stack Exchange Data Explore via SQL, popularity was defined based on community engagement (measured by vote score) and used features such as title length, tag count, posting hour, and day of the week as predictors. The Bayesian Logistic Regression model is implemented in Stan, and uses a weakly informative prior to normalize estimation and account for any variation in any noisy patterns. Model performance is assessed through posterior predictive checks, AUC, accuracy, and calibration analysis. Results are benchmarked against a Frequentist Logistic Regression baseline. A prior sensitivity analysis was also completed to evaluate the robustness of our posterior inferences. Our findings suggest tags and day of the week moderately influence the question's popularity. It was also found that the Bayesian model yields better-calibrated probability estimates. This research project demonstrates the true strength of a Bayesian workflow in understanding content dynamics on large, user-generated platforms, while also offering practical insight to optimize user attraction, content engagement, and more.
